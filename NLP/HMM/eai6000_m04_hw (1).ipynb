        "Denote the hidden states of the HMM by `S(t)` and the observations (evidence) by `E(t)`. In the weather problem from the HMM Tutorial, X(t) would be either sunny, rainy, or foggy, and `E(t)` is yes or no to indicate if an umbrella was observed. We will use this model with prior probabilities P(sunny) = 0.5, P(rainy) = 0.25, P(foggy) = 0.25. The remaining probilities you need are specified below in the emisssion (`P_emission`) and transition matrices (`P_transition`).\n",
